# Digital-Image-Processing-Watermarking-
This work was a part of course project of 'Digital Image Processing' course during my MSc. class.

Digital watermarking is a technique to hide the copyright information into the digital data through certain algorithm.

The watermark:
  1. is embedded into the host media to be protected, such as an image, audio or video.
  2. can be detected or extracted later to make an assertion about the host media.
  3. should not alter the quality and visually of the host image and it should be perceptually invisible.
  4. robust with respect to image distortions, i.e.
        * difficult for an attacker to remove
        * robust to common image processing and geometric operations, such as filtering, resizing, cropping and image compression.
        
Try to run the notebook file to figure it out by your own.

Look at the [presentation](www.google.com) provided to see the result and some analysis.
